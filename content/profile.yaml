  about: |
    I am a freelance full stack software developer and I have developed software for a variety of industries, including healthcare, and the government. I have excellent communication skills and I work equally well as a team member or individually. Recently I was solely responsible for the development of a compliance and reporting tool. The timeframe for delivery was very tight and I was successfully able to develop a solution to our clients problem - on time and on budget.

    I am comfortable working across the full technology stack from frontend development to DevOps. I also enjoy working in an agile environment and believe the rituals established are extremely beneficial to the success of the project.

    I have a unique background with extensive experience as an airline pilot. I believe that the skills and experience I have gained as a pilot have given me a valuable perspective as a software developer. My attention to detail, reliability, and ability to think critically in high-pressure situations have all transferred over into my work as a developer.

    Thanks for taking the time to learn a little more about me. I look forward to collaborating with you and using my skills to help bring your projects to life!
